# myPortfolio: Description

This was my first portfolio I had created before I learned the tips and tricks of using CSS and HTML.This project provided me with an outline on the things I should include in my current portfolio and the things I should leave out. 




# User Stories/Functionality

This app is a two page application where you can scroll down and learn more about me. If you want to see my projects, the "My Creations" sections provides a tab to click on where it directs you to another page with a list of projects I have built. 

# Technologies 


The application was built with HTML & CSS. It was initially deployed to github pages before I updated my portfilio. I used HTML tags and incorporated CSS for styling purposed. 




# Issues/Improvements

The app was not mobile responsive and it did not look as professional as it could. Therefore, I improve this application by creating a new portfolio for myself. It can be found in my repository list in my Github.
